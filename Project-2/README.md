The Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP) is an open-source software platform that automates the orchestration, management, and operationalization of network services and their corresponding infrastructure components. Developed under the Linux Foundation, ONAP combines various functions like design, creation, and lifecycle management of network elements to support network service providers in creating a scalable and flexible network architecture. Key features include real-time, policy-driven orchestration and automation, enabling rapid service deployment and innovation, and providing tools for extensive monitoring, analytics, and lifecycle management.
